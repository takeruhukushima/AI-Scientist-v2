        "Abstract": "This research introduces a novel approach to antifogging coatings by creating shirasu-derived porous glass films with dynamic pore size modulation based on ambient humidity. The porous structure, formed via spinodal decomposition, provides the foundation for antifogging through superhydrophilicity and water absorption. To achieve humidity-responsive behavior, a hygroscopic polymer (e.g., poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) or poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOX)) will be incorporated within the pores. At low humidity, the polymer shrinks, maximizing pore size and light transmission. As humidity increases, the polymer absorbs water, causing it to swell and reduce the pore size, optimizing water absorption and preventing fog formation. This dynamic adjustment allows the coating to maintain optimal antifogging performance and transparency across a wide range of humidity levels. We will optimize the composition of the shirasu glass, the pore size, and the type and concentration of hygroscopic polymer to achieve the desired humidity response. The resulting coatings will be characterized for antifogging performance, response time, durability, and optical properties.
