## TL;DR
We develop porous glass thin films with spinodal structure using shirasu as a raw material to overcome the limitations of conventional antifogging coating technologies. This innovative approach aims to achieve next-generation antifogging materials with both durability and transparency.

## Abstract
This research focuses on two critical challenges in the field of antifogging materials: "enhancing durability" and "ensuring optical transparency," proposing an innovative solution utilizing shirasu, a local resource. While conventional antifogging coating technologies have demonstrated certain effectiveness through the use of hydrophilic polymers and water-repellent agents, they face practical limitations such as performance degradation during long-term use and constraints in optical properties.

Our approach utilizes spinodal decomposition, a physical phenomenon, to create nanoscale porous structures in shirasu-derived glass thin films, aiming to overcome these challenges. Shirasu, primarily composed of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) and other inorganic oxides with extremely low organic impurity content, is expected to maintain stable performance even under high-temperature conditions and UV exposure.

The key features of this approach include:

1. **Sustainable Antifogging Performance**: Simultaneous achievement of superhydrophilicity and water absorption through spinodal structure-induced porosity
2. **Superior Optical Properties**: High transparency and anti-reflection effects due to low refractive index
3. **Local Resource Utilization**: Adding high value to shirasu, an underutilized resource
4. **Environmental Consideration**: Realization of sustainable material usage

The outcomes of this research are expected to find applications in various fields, including eyeglass lenses, window glass, automobile windshields, and solar panels. Additionally, it holds academic significance in creating novel surface functions by applying the physical phenomenon of spinodal phase separation to functional material design.

Thus, this research presents an effective solution to the challenge of improving the durability of antifogging coatings, aiming to contribute to safety and efficiency improvements across various fields through its practical applications.

# Research Background on Antifogging Materials Using Spinodal Structure Derived from Shirasu

## Importance and Applications of Antifogging Materials

Transparent glass and resins are essential in daily life and industry, used in various applications such as mirrors, windows, automobile windshields, and eyeglasses. However, in high-humidity environments, water droplets condense on surfaces, causing fogging that reduces light transmittance and leads to visibility issues and safety/health concerns. Therefore, antifogging technology is highly valued across a wide range of applications, from optical devices to architectural fields. The following are examples of areas requiring antifogging performance:

- **Visual Applications**: Eyeglass lenses, protective goggles, camera and telescope optical lenses
- **Architecture and Vehicles**: Window glass, bathroom mirrors, automobile windshields
- **Industrial Fields**: Solar panels, liquid crystal displays, glass in refrigerated showcases

Beyond these examples, there is growing demand for antifogging materials in various fields such as medical devices and food industry, leading to active research and development in antifogging technology in recent years.

## Conventional Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Coating Methods and Their Limitations

Conventional antifogging coatings can be broadly categorized into **hydrophilic** and **hydrophobic** approaches. In the hydrophilic approach, hydrophilic agents (e.g., hydrophilic polymers, surfactants, hydrophilic oxide coatings) are applied to the surface to spread water droplets into a thin water film for transparency. On the other hand, in the hydrophobic approach, the self-adhesion of water droplets is reduced, making it difficult for small droplets to grow (superhydrophobic surfaces have water droplets in spherical shape and roll off easily) ([(PDF) Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=suppress%20fogging%20b%20y%20adopting,5%5D.%20Benefitted%20from%20the)) ([(PDF) Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=bottom%20layers%20%20capped%20,15%5D.%20These))。However, these conventional methods have been pointed out to have some limitations:

- **Durability and Weather Resistance**: Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic coatings may not be stable over long periods in outdoor environments or high-humidity conditions. For example, hydrophilic coatings may dissolve or deteriorate over time in water, and hydrophobic agents (e.g., fluorine compounds) may lose activity. Additionally, the resistance to scratches and wear is not sufficient for industrial applications, so the challenge is to improve the durability of the coating.

- **Optical Transparency**: When forming a fogging film on a transparent substrate, there is a possibility that light scattering or reflection may increase, reducing the transmittance compared to the original substrate. Especially in the case of thick application of polymers or particles, there may be slight haziness or optical distortion. It is necessary to design the film to achieve both transparency and anti-fogging, which was a constraint in conventional methods.

In summary, conventional antifogging coating technologies are not necessarily long-term stable and ideal in optical properties. Therefore, there is a need for research to simultaneously improve the durability and transparency of antifogging performance.

## Control of Wetting Property and Spinodal Porous Structure

It is known that the wetting property (hydrophilic/hydrophobic) of a material can be physically adjusted by controlling the micro/nano structure of the surface. For example, **superhydrophobic** surfaces are characterized by a micro/nano two-layer structure that greatly increases the water contact angle (the lotus effect where water droplets roll off) and is applied to dirt prevention, etc. ([(PDF) Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=suppress%20fogging%20b%20y%20adopting,5%5D.%20Benefitted%20from%20the))). Conversely, in **superhydrophilic** surfaces, the nano structure draws water in and spreads it widely, so it can suppress water droplet formation. In this way, by adjusting the wetting property of the surface by nano scale structural design without relying on chemical properties, it can lead to improvements in the durability and new functions of the coating.

Especially in the case of antifogging, **nanoporous structure** is considered effective for superhydrophilic/water absorption. In surfaces with nanoscale pores, water droplets are quickly absorbed and diffused on the surface, preventing the formation of micro droplets. In fact, it has been reported that by heat-treating inorganic materials such as glass to create a microphase separation and porous structure, they exhibit excellent antifogging effects ([Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=%E4%BB%8A%E5%9B%9E%E7%99%BA%E8%A1%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E6%96%B0%E3%81%9F%E3%81%AA%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E5%A4%9A%E5%AD%94%E8%B3%AA%E3%82%AC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E8%96%84%E8%86%9C%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E8%A6%AA%E6%B0%B4%E6%80%A7%E3%81%AB%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%88%E3%80%81%E8%96%84%E8%86%9C%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%9A%E5%AD%94%E8%B3%AA%E5%8C%96%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E5%90%B8%E6%B0%B4%E6%80%A7%E3%82%92%E7%99%BA%E7%8F%BE%E3%81%95%E3%81%9B%E3%82%8B%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AB%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E3%80%82%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E3%80%81%E5%84%AA%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E9%98%B2%E6%9B%87%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E3%82%92%E9%95%B7%E6%9C%9F%E9%96%93%E7%B6%AD%E6%8C%81%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%20%E6%80%A7%E3%81%8C%E7%A4%BA%E5%94%86%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E3%80%82%E9%98%B2%E6%9B%87%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E3%83%8B%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%81%AE%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B%E5%88%86%E9%87%8E%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E7%9C%BC%E9%8F%A1%E3%80%81%E6%B0%B4%E4%B8%AD%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B0%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E3%81%BB%E3%81%8B%E3%80%81%E7%AA%93%E3%82%AC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%80%81%E9%8F%A1%E3%80%81%E5%86%B7%E5%87%8D%E3%83%BB%E5%86%B7%E8%94%B5%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A9%E5%A4%9A%E5%B2%90%E3%81%AB%E3%82%8F%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8B%E3%80%82))。This porous structure can be produced by utilizing the physical phenomenon of spinodal decomposition (spinodal decomposition) ([(PDF) Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=B_))). In this mechanism, since the material separates continuously without going through the process of nucleus formation, a continuous nanodomain structure is formed. Depending on the glass composition, spinodal decomposition may occur, resulting in a uniform porous structure composed of silica skeletons when the latter is dissolved in the drug solution ([Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=%E3%82%B9%E3%83%94%E3%83%8E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%AB%E5%88%86%E8%A7%A3%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E3%80%81SiO_%7B2%7D%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%83%81%E7%9B%B8%E3%81%A8Na_%7B2%7DO))). This method produces porous glass with a sharp pore size distribution and excellent heat resistance, so it is used in industrial processes such as filtration and catalyst carriers ([Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=%E5%A4%9A%E5%AD%94%E8%B3%AA%E3%82%AC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AF%E7%B4%B0%E5%AD%94%E5%BE%84%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83%E3%81%8C%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%81%AA%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%80%81%E5%88%86%E9%9B%A2%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%84%E8%A7%A6%E5%AA%92%E3%81%AE%E6%8B%85%E4%BD%93%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A9%E3%82%92%E3%81%AF%E3%81%98%E3%82%81%E3%80%81%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AD%E3%83%9E%E3%83%88%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E7%94%A8%E6%8B%85%E4%BD%93%E3%80%81%E3%82%A8%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E8%AA%BF%E8%A3%BD%E7%94%A8%E3%83%87%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9%E3%82%84%E6%9C%89%E5%AE%B3%E7%89%A9%E8%B3%AA%E3%81%AE%E5%90%B8%E7%9D%80%E7%AD%89%E3%81%AB%E7%94%A8%E3%81%84%E3%82%89)) ([Highly durable antifogging coatings resistant to long-term airborne pollution and intensive UV irradiation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342878255_Highly_durable_antifogging_coatings_resistant_to_long-term_airborne_pollution_and_intensive_UV_irradiation#:~:text=%E5%A4%9A%E5%AD%94%E8%B3%AA%E3%82%AC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AE%E8%A3%BD%E6%B3%95%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E5%88%86%E7%9B%B8%E6%B3%95%E3%80%81%E3%82%BE%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B2%E3%83%AB%E6%B3%95%E3%81%AB%E5%88%86%E9%A1%9E%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%81%8C%E3%80%81%E5%8F%8C%E6%96%B9%E3%81%A8%E3%82%82%E7%B4%B0%E5%AD%94%E3%81%AE%E5%BD%A2%E6%88%90%E3%81%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%83%94%E3%83%8E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%AB%E5%88%86%E8%A7%A3%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E5%A4%9A%E5%AD%94%E8%B3%AA%E3%82%AC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E5%9D%87%E8%B3%AA%E3%81%AA%E7%B4%B0%E5%AD%94%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8B%E3%81%A4%E8%80%90%E7%86%B1%E6%80%A7%E3%82%82%E9%AB%98%E3%81%84%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%20%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E3%80%81%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%80%81%E4%B9%B3%E5%8C%96%E3%80%81%E6%8E%92%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%82%84%E5%9B%BA%E5%AE%9A%E5%8C%96%E9%85%B5%E7%B4%A0%E3%81%AE%E8%A7%A6%E5%AA%92%E6%8B%85%E4%BD%93%E3%81%A8%E5%B9%85%E5%BA%83%E3%81%84%E7%94%A8%E9%80%94%E3%81%AB%E7%94%A8%E3%81%84%E3%82%89%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8B%E3%81%A7%E3%82%82%E3%80%81%E5%9B%BA%E5%AE%9A%E5%8C%96%E9%85%B5%E7%B4%A0%E7%94%A8%E9%80%94%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AF%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%89%E5%90%88%E6%88%90%E3%81%AE%E6%9D%90%E6%96%99%E3%81%A8%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E3%82%82%E7%94%A8%E3%81%84%E3%82%89%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A6%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8A%E3%80%81%E6%9C%AA%E6%9D%A5%E6%9D%90%E6%96%99%20%E3%81%A8%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E3%82%82%E6%9C%9F%E5%BE%85%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82))).

Such a spinodal-derived nanoporous thin film exhibits ideal properties for antifogging, with superhydrophilic and water-absorbing properties. By adjusting the pore size and pore rate, it is possible to optimize the performance of suppressing water condensation and the antifogging property, which is pointed out to be greatly dependent on the pore size distribution ( [Spinodal Decomposition by a Two-Step Procedure for Nano Porous Silica - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11613344/#:~:text=skeletons%2C13%20and%20antifogging%20property%20was,of%20the%20coating%20reached%20several) )。Also, since the air is contained in the pores, the apparent refractive index is lowered, reducing the interface reflection with the substrate, and thus obtaining high transparency (anti-reflection effect). In fact, it has been reported that by using a porous glass film with silicon nanoparticles, the visible light transmittance was increased to 98-99% or more while achieving superhydrophilic properties ([Antifogging and Antireflection Coatings Fabricated by Integrating Solid and Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles without Any Post-Treatments | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225184007_Antifogging_and_Antireflection_Coatings_Fabricated_by_Integrating_Solid_and_Mesoporous_Silica_Nanoparticles_without_Any_Post-Treatments#:~:text=transmittance%20of%2098.5,influence%20of%20mesopores%20was%20also)) ([Antifogging and Antireflection Coatings Fabricated by Integrating Solid and Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles without Any Post-Treatments | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225184007_Antifogging_and_Antireflection_Coatings_Fabricated_by_Integrating_Solid_and_Mesoporous_Silica_Nanoparticles_without_Any_Post-Treatments#:~:text=characterized%20by%20UV,both%20light%20transmission%20and%20hydrophilicity))). In other words, it shows the possibility of simultaneously achieving **durability** and **optical transparency** of antifogging performance.

## Significance and Advantages of Shirasu as a Raw Material

The **shirasu** that this research focuses on is volcanic ash (accumulated ash) in the south Kyushu area ( [Extraction of spinodal decomposition regulators in Shirasu porous glass thin film formation | CiNii Research](https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1390571968052685184#:~:text=,in%20producing%20a%20porous%20thin) )). Shirasu is an underutilized resource abundant in the region, and utilizing it for materials is meaningful from the viewpoint of resource efficient utilization and local production. It is also advantageous in that it has a low raw material cost and can be mass-produced ( [Extraction of spinodal decomposition regulators in Shirasu porous glass thin film formation | CiNii Research](https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1390571968052685184#:~:text=,in%20producing%20a%20porous%20thin) )).

Shirasu itself is primarily composed of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) and other inorganic oxides with extremely low organic impurity content, making it a **inorganic material** with a low organic impurity content. Therefore, the thin film from shirasu is expected to maintain stable performance even under high-temperature conditions and UV exposure (there is little decomposition due to organic high molecular coating such as heat or light). Also, since shirasu contains glass particles, it allows **film formation** by melting or firing due to sputtering method or sol-gel method ( [Extraction of spinodal decomposition regulators in Shirasu porous glass thin film formation | CiNii Research](https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1390571968052685184#:~:text=,in%20producing%20a%20porous%20thin) )). In fact, the shirasu-derived glass thin film has been confirmed to have excellent characteristics of **low refractive index and high transparency** and hydrophilic properties ( [Extraction of spinodal decomposition regulators in Shirasu porous glass thin film formation | CiNii Research](https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1390571968052685184#:~:text=,in%20producing%20a%20porous%20thin) )). This is an ideal property for optical coating materials and the potential to improve the transparency without damaging the original transparency when applied to the substrate.

From the above, by utilizing shirasu as a raw material,

- **Low Cost and Large Supply**: It is possible to mass-produce at a low cost by utilizing local resources
    
- **High Durability**: High durability and heat resistance due to inorganic materials
    
- **Excellent Film Formation**: Processing suitability for glass thin film (easily handled with existing film formation technology)
    
- **Optical Suitability**: Both low refractive index and hydrophilic properties ( [Extraction of spinodal decomposition regulators in Shirasu porous glass thin film formation | CiNii Research](https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1390571968052685184#:~:text=,in%20producing%20a%20porous%20thin) )
    

These advantages are obtained in this research, which is significant in material selection.

## Necessity and Positioning of This Research

From the above background, **antifogging materials with long-term durability and excellent optical properties** are highly required. While conventional technologies could not avoid the degradation of hydrophilic coatings and transparency issues, a new approach combining nano structure (porous structure by spinodal decomposition) and local resource shirasu could overcome these issues. This research is aimed at forming a porous structure of spinodal structure in shirasu-derived glass thin films to stabilize the antifogging effect. The **superhydrophilic/water-absorbing hybrid thin film** with water absorption by porous structure while utilizing the hydrophilic properties of shirasu is expected to significantly improve the durability of conventional antifogging materials ( [Extraction of spinodal decomposition regulators in Shirasu porous glass thin film formation | CiNii Research](https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1390571968052685184#:~:text=index%2C%20high%20transparency%2C%20and%20hydrophilic,thin%20film%20prepared%20by%20the) )). Also, since it is also excellent optically, it can provide added value (antifogging + high transparency) for transparent substrates such as lenses and solar panels.

Thus, this research presents **innovative coating technology with superior durability and transparency** in the field of antifogging materials. Its academic significance lies in creating novel surface functions by applying the physical phenomenon of spinodal phase separation to functional material design. Also, as a research and development of regional revitalization type materials adding high value to underutilized resource shirasu and contributing to sustainable material usage. Taking these points into account, this research presents an effective solution to the challenge of improving the durability of antifogging coatings, aiming to contribute to safety and efficiency improvements across various fields through its practical applications.
